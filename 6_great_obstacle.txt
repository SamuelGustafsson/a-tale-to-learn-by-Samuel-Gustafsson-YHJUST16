On their way to the magical cave there was a large flood guarded by Brad Pitt's evil pet porcupine. They stopped and Chuck Norris said:
 - What the heck, none of this is not supposed to be here!


The Porcupine stared at them with it's glowing eyes and it's tuxedo filled with holes from the sharp quills. 


Morgan Freeman:
 - It must be Brad Pitt who cast a spell to stop us!


Chuck:
 - Oh that handsome, rich bastard! My gorgeous legs can't help us with this one!


But suddenly a loud and deep voice said:
 - Good im with you then guys!


Its was Dumbledore, Chuck's pet and sidekick fly with an enormus ego speaking from Chuck's side pocket.


Dumbledore:
 - I can help you, he said and flew out of pocket.
 - Chuck jump up on my back!.

A second later they were in the air. Chuck on Dumbledore's back and the ugly giraffe morgan hanging in the tail from Dumbledore's mouth. And so they flew to safety, ignoring both the flood and the evil porcupine.

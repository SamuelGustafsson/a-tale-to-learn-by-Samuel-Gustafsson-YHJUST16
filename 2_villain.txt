The handsome rich giraffe Brad Pitt, who was also a voodoo-giraffe,
had cursed Morgan Freeman with uglyness, homelessness and vaporised
all of his friends.

Brad Pitt was a mad one, that's for sure!
You could easily spot his madness because of his piké-shirt collection
with prints like "I am crazy like Patrick Swayze." or "Programmers sux!".

Brad Pitt had a pet porcupine that used to come to his aid when it was needed the most. The porcupine was always wearing a tuxedo, since it liked to express how rich it was.

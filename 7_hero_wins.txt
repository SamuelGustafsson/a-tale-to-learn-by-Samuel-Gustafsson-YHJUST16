Chuck:
 - Dumbledore, you can land here, it's not so far to the magical cave.


Morgan:
 - Finally, I do not know how much more my tail can handle. And your teeth are really sharp Dumbledore!


Our heroes can now see the cave, but there is someone standing outside the cave.


Morgan screams:
 - Oh no, it's Brad Pitt! What should we do!


Dumbledore:
 - I dont know!


After a long strange silence Chuck says:
 

- There's only one thing to do, we are going to redecorate his handsome face!
And so they did. Brad maby was rich and handsome, but it really doesn't matter if you are against three other weirdos.
